# This file contains Eliza's responses.
# It is based on the implementation here:
#    http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/software/eliza
#
# All lines that begin with a hash symbol are comments, and are ignored.
#
# This file should have the following format:
#   1. Each section of the file should begin with at least one blank line.
#   2. The next line should be a regular expression, matching a user input.
#   3. Each subsequent line, until a blank line, should contain a response to
#      the user input. One of these will be chosen at random upon user input.
#   4. After the responses, there should be at least one blank.
#
# Regular expressions should follow the syntax here:
#    https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax
#
# In the regular expressions, anything in parentheses is captured and
# available in the responses as $n where $n is the n^th captured group.
# Thus $1 is the first captured group, and $4 is the fourth.
#
# Eliza will try to match the regular expressions in the order they appear in
# this file, and stop at the first match. Thus earlier ones have precedence.
